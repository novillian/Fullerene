#Fullerene

###### *Graphite Windows*

## What is this nonsense?
    
    Fullerene is a lightweight Carbon daemon for MS Windows Performance counters. It is 
    written in C# and runs as a Windows Service. It will ship with an installer and I
    may provide either a GUI to modify settings or (more likely) a powershell config
    module

## Why not just use the existing tools? There's a great powershell graphite script out there.
    
    While I quite enjoy the existing tools/scripts, the overhead of a service manager (such as NSSM) and 
    the easy editability of the running script is currently undesireable. I am aiming to
    provide a simple installer driven Windows service that can run with little worry.  
    
## What's with the name?
    
    *A fullerene is a molecule of carbon in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, and many other shapes.* [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullerene)
    If you have really small eyes, nanotubes may look like windows. Well... really long windows.
